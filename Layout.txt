Here is where we can decide what pages we want and what goes where.

This is a test to see if I fixed the upstream issue.
	P.S. It didn't work


Plot design page:
graph - visualization
	walkways
	different colors (picked by user)
		colors represent crop
	a key - colors match
	spacing tool?
	recommendations?
	N direction - for sunlight

Calendar page
When crops were planted
	when sprouted
	when to harvest

recommended times of year to plant
	based on user's zone?

optional alerts?

Info page:
planting times
sprout times
image
height
spacing
how to preserve or cook?

Search page
find crops
filter by type, time of year to grow
scroll through all?
filter by cuisine?
